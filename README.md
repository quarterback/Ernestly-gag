# 🌐 Ernestly: Where Disruption Meets Procurement

**Ernestly** is a satirical civic tech conference website that parodies the intersection of blockchain enthusiasm, venture capital, and public sector innovation. This fictional event skewers the tech-solutionist language, startup aesthetic, and token-obsessed culture that permeates the "gov tech" space.

## 🔍 About the Project

Ernestly isn't real. But it could be.

This satirical conference exists as a critique of the often absurd collision between Silicon Valley mentality and civic institutions, where:

- Democracy becomes a "legacy system" in need of "disruption"
- Public goods are reframed as "tokenizable assets"
- Community engagement is replaced by "protocol governance"
- Social impact is measured in "founder exits"

**Trust is optional. Funding is not.**
