# Ernestly: A Civic Future. Now.

**Ernestly** is a fictional civic tech conference site, built to satirize the polished aesthetic and techno-optimist language of solutionist culture. It’s what happens when crypto libertarians, civic tech grifters, and predictive policing evangelists throw a summit together—with a design system.

This project is built using:
- [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [USWDS (U.S. Web Design System)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)
- Custom content and styling to evoke a crypto-conference vibe
- Designed for deployment on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

## What Is This?

Ernestly isn’t real. But it could be.

This mock conference exists to parody:
- Civic tech culture’s startup envy
- Blockchain-fueled governance experiments
- The performative sincerity of gov-adjacent innovation
- The absurd confidence of people who “tokenize trust”

Ernestly is both a joke and a critique—and dangerously close to sounding plausible.
